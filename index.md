## What is the Nickel Club?

### Why does this exist?

<br>

## Wagering Nickels {#wagering}
<br>
Once you have Nickels you're encouraged to wager them with Nick.

You can never go into negative Nickels, so you'll never have to buy Nick anything.

#### Challenging Nick's beliefs {#beliefs}

If you find something you disagree on with Nick, you can wager a Nickel.

Wagers should be on something that can be observed at a set deadline.

You can wager on whether a certain event will happen by a certain time, or whether a certain fact will turn out to be true. You can't wager on whether God exists.

## Nickel Accounting {#accounting}

Nick will track your [Nickel balance](/balance/) for you.

## Leaving the Nickel Club {#leaving}

You can instantly leave the Nickel Club at any time (although probably best to let Nick know).
