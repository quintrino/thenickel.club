_Welcome,_

_You have been invited to join the prestigious Nickel club!_

### What is the Nickel Club?

The Nickel Club is a group of Nick Wolf's friends who can earn, spend and wager
_Nickels_.

_Nickels_ are a fictional currency you can earn from Nick Wolf that you can then
spend for Nick to buy you fabulous prizes.

##### Why does this exist?

This is a way for Nick to reward his friends when they help him grow.

### Earning Nickels

<br>

There are a number of activities that will earn you Nickels.

<p>
<h4>Capturing photos</h4>

If you take a photo of Nick that's good enough for his Social Media or Online
Dating Profile Pic you earn two Nickels.

</p>
<p>
<h4>Behaviour Training</h4>

If you help train Nick on various behaviours he's working on you'll earn Nickels

### Spending Nickels

<br>

There are a number of default rewards you can spend your Nickels on, but you
can also negotiate if you want something else instead.

#### **Exchange Rate**

Nick will catch up with you and deliver the following prizes

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Cost</th>
    <th>Prize</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 Nickel</td>
    <td>1 Coffee/Tea</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2 Nickels</td>
    <td>1 Beer/Alcoholic Beverage or equivalent</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4 Nickels</td>
    <td>1 Meal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Negotiable</td>
    <td>Have Nick help you train your own behaviours</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Negotiable</td>
    <td>Have Nick buy you something else</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Wagering Nickels

Once you have Nickels you're encouraged to wager them with Nick.

You can never go into negative Nickels, so you'll never have to buy Nick
anything.

<p>
<h4>Challenging Nick's beliefs</h4>

If you find something you disagree on with Nick, you can wager a Nickel.

Wagers should be on something that can be observed at a set deadline.

You can wager on whether a certain event will happen by a certain time, or
whether a certain fact will turn out to be true. You can't wager on whether
God exists.

</p>

### Nickel Accounting

Nick will track your Nickel balance for you.

### Leaving the Nickel Club

You can instantly leave the Nickel club at any time
(although probably best to let Nick know).
